                Git is a <strong>version control system used on the command line</strong> so developers can keep track of all 
                the code changes they make to a project. It also allows developers to <strong>collaborate</strong>. Instead of 
                having to email code back and forth, people can download the latest version of a project and keep track of the 
                revisions they make to the code. There are other version control systems, but Git is the most popular.

                GitHub is <strong>a development platform that uses git</strong>, so developers can store their projects where others 
                can easily view and access them. There are other similar services like GitLab and BitBucket. I personally prefer 
                GitHub. You can

                When working with git and any service like GitHub be aware of <strong>ReadMe, Pull Requests, and Commit Messages.</strong>
                <ul class="subject__p-list">
                    <li class="subject__p-list-item">
                        <strong>Readme</strong>, often seen as README.md, uses the markdown syntax and contains documentation about 
                        repos. Always include one in any repo you make.
                    </li>
                    <li class="subject__p-list-item">
                        <strong>Pull Requests</strong> are used with teams and open source communities. On GitHub it is seen on of 
                        the top tabs under the repos name. Pull Requests are used to show other developers code you have added or 
                        changed to a repo. After adding code to your forked version of the repo, go to the  original repo, and use 
                        the Pull Request button to submit your changed code. 
                    </li>
                    <li class="subject__p-list-item">    
                        <strong>Commit Messages</strong> are messages you write in the terminal once you have added files to your 
                        local repo with <code class="subject__p-list-item-code">git add [file]</code>. Use the command 
                        <code class="subject__p-list-item-code">git commit -m "put text in single or double quotes"</code> This 
                        message will show up in your repo so you know when you made what changes. To make a multi-line message, simple
                        press enter before closing the quotes.
